```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

 
## create scatter plot
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
data("mtcars")
as.data.frame(mtcars)

 
 
plot_ly(mtcars,x=wt,y=mpg,mode="markers")

```

 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
